# Instructions to play with Quickstart 

This Quickstart contains 2 Spring Boot applications where the REST `Say` service calls the REST `Greeting` service. 
The project can be used locally and launched using Spring Boot Maven plugin or deployed on OpenShift.

To support multiple environments, 2 profiles have been defined within the `application.yaml` file. The `development` profile,
which is passed as a configuration property for the `Say` service will be used when the application is launched locally
using Spring Boot Maven plugin.

The `kubernetes` profile will be used, if Spring Boot detects that the `Say` application is running on OpenShift. To enable this behavior
, a Spring ApplicationListener Context, packaged with the Spring Cloud Kubernetes Core [module](https://github.com/spring-cloud-incubator/spring-cloud-kubernetes/blob/master/spring-cloud-kubernetes-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/kubernetes/profile/KubernetesProfileApplicationListener.java#L46),
has been included within the `Say` application.

Remark: As the `Say` Spring Boot application is turned into an Kubenetes client communicating with the platform, then it is required
to grant access to the account. See more info hereafter

## Locally

- Greeting Service
```bash
cd greeting-service
mvn clean compile && mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Say Service
```bash
cd say-service
mvn compile spring-boot:run
```

- Call the service
```bash
http http://localhost:8090/say
HTTP/1.1 200 
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
    "content": "Hello, World!",
    "id": 1
}
```

## Deploy Services on OpenShift

- Start a Minishift VM on MacOS using Xhyve hypervisor
```bash
minishift --profile istio-demo config set image-caching true
minishift --profile istio-demo config set memory #GB
minishift --profile istio-demo config set memory 3GB
minishift --profile istio-demo config set openshift-version v3.7.0-rc.0
minishift --profile istio-demo config set vm-driver xhyve
minishift --profile istio-demo addon enable admin-user
minishift start --profile istio-demo
```

- Log to openshift and creatde a ``demo`` project
```bash
oc login $(minishift ip):8443 -u admin -p admin
oc new-project demo
```

- Grant access for the `Say` application to access the platform as a Kubernetes Client and get info about the environment. 
  So, assign the view access role to the `default` service account.
  This [service account](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/dev_guide/service_accounts.html) provides a flexible way
  to control API access without sharing a regular userâ€™s credentials. It is mounted within the `Say` pod when it is created.
  It corresponds to a token which is permanent.
                                                                                                            
```bash
oc policy add-role-to-user view -n $(oc project -q) -z default
```
- Deploy the 2 Services
```bash
cd greeting-service
mvn fabric8:deploy -Popenshift

cd say-service
mvn fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
```
- Call the `Say` service
```bash
SAY_SERVICE=$(minishift openshift service --url say-service)
http $SAY_SERVICE/say
```
